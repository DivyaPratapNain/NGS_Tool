CPC2 Insrtallation:
AFter downlaoding the CPC2 github ,
the CPC2.py is altered for python3. command replaced with subprocess, and also all print anything converted to print(anything).

#You need to install anaconda as well in the host system. And also make the conda env (base) and then install tools in that , and then add them to path as well.



✅ Solution A: Make sure tools are available in WSL's path
In your WSL terminal, do this:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano ~/.bashrc
Add this line at the bottom if not already present:

bash
Copy
Edit
export PATH="$HOME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
Then save and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
source ~/.bashrc
Now confirm tools are available by running in WSL:

bash
Copy
Edit
which STAR
which stringtie
which gffcompare
They should point to paths like /home/divya/anaconda3/bin/STAR.

✅ If all good, retry your pipeline.
